# Allowed number of prerelease rules: 1..3
# While semantic-release allows globs, they must be combined with `prerelease: true` and suffix is derived from name than. It conflicts with PEP440 
# PEP440 version rules (not compatible with SemVer): [N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]
# Consequences:
#   - prerelease branches must be explicitly specified, no asterisks
#   - prerelease parameter should be one of: a,b,rc,dev,post
#   - translation from SemVer prerelease notation to PEP440 is tone in 'replacements' section
branches: # only branches listed here will create releases
  - master
  - name: ci/trusted_publishing_test
    prerelease: dev
  #- name: develop
  #  prerelease: dev
  #- name: feature/*
  #  prerelease: true   # will use branch name as suffix
